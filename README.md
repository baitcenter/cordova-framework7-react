### Preface

This boilerplate is a full fledged __PRODUCTION READY__ workflow boilerplate for building complex application.

The technologies used in this workflow boilerplate shows case a `subset of technologies` we are currently using within our team ( __we put this project in github mainly as recruiting purpose for our team__ ),  and we are trying to give our candidates confidence that by working with us, they will be using decent technologies as well as staying relevant to the industry.  And that is what our team strongly believed in - __technology innovation and promoting developers' relevancy in the industry__.
